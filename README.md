# Predicting-Crimes-in-Philadelphia

The name of my project is: Predicting Crimes in Philadelphia

The names and Cornell IDs of the project members are: Fiona Chin (flc38), Erik Enriquez (eee37),  Yumeng Niu (yn227)

A one or two paragraph description of my project is:

We are primarily using the dataset on Kaggle “Philadelphia Crime Data” (https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/philadelphiacrimedata). From this dataset, we are trying to examine the historical crime data in Philadelphia from 2006 to 2016 to predict number of criminal incidents in the future, categorized by districts and crime types. The primary factors we want to use includes district, time, latitude, longitude, number of incidents in the past, and type.

The problem is important because predicting crime can help determine the required size and budget of Philly’s police department. Predicting crime rates can potentially lower the death toll associated with crime and make Philly a safer place to live.
